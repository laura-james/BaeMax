# Project-Baemax
## Project Summary: 
Studies have shown a concerning rise in social media usage among the
general population, leading to detrimental effects on their mental health and overall well-being.
Moreover, the spread of false information on various platforms has contributed to a decline in
critical thinking skills and a lack of trust in reliable sources This leads to misguided beliefs and
potentially harmful behaviours such as flat earth theories and anti-vax conspiracies. In a world
where information is readily accessible but often unreliable, it is crucial to equip this generation
with the skills to discern fact from fiction and allow them to make informed decisions.

Over 70 percent of Europeans regularly meet fake news. This influences the way people act and
manipulates people’s opinions and beliefs. Misinformation exploits negative emotions like
anger, hatred, or fear, turning people against each other and fuels division and polarization.

We have built a chatroom where individuals can engage with experts such as climate scientists,
researchers, and educators to gain correct information and insights on diverse topics. This
initiative aims to foster a culture of curiosity and critical thinking among our youth whilst also
providing correct information and varied opinions from experts. By creating a positive and
trustworthy environment we can help teach young people to distinguish fact from fiction and be
less susceptible to brainwashing and manipulation.

We have also created an add-on Chrome extension that promotes mindful browsing by filtering
out harmful information and promoting positive content. This tool will help users navigate the
digital landscape more consciously and safely. By leveraging technology to promote mindful
consumption, we hope to create a more balanced and enriching online experience for users of all
ages.
Our third addition is a daily facts generator that aims to keep people well-informed and
educated on current events and important topics. By increasing the general literacy of our
population, we aim to empower individuals to become interested in world news.
In conclusion, it is vital that we take proactive measures to address the problems created by
excessive social media usage, misinformation, and low media literacy. Through innovative
solutions, we can create a more informed, engaged, and resilient society for generations to come.
To take on this project, it was divided into hardware and software then into smaller parts. For
the hardware we separated the lights and the moulding and for app software, into login,
chatrooms, fact generator, interface design and chrome extension. Breaking down the project
into smaller simpler parts made it easier to tackle and gave everyone something they can do.
Hafsa focused on the software coding, making the chatrooms login and chrome extension and
Wendy coded the fact generator. The graphics, logo and video were put together by Esther, the
lights were wired up by Sophie and we painted and made the main body together.

We chose to make the main body using paper mâché and paint it using acrylic paint so that the
LED lights would still be able to shine through. For the lighting we used small LED lamps on a
breadboard connected to the raspberry PIs which we connected to the monitors at school to test
the code
